The shortest program in Java Script is an empty file. Wondering why? Look below......

Even though the file is empty the JS engine will still do its work.
The JS engine creates "Global exectuion context" and sets up memory space.
The JS Engine also creates "Window" 

What is window?
Window is like an object with lot of functions and variables.
We can access these functions and variables anywhere in the program.
Window is a global object which is created along with the "global exexution context"

In case of browsers the global object created is called "window"
JS is not just run on browser but it can run on servers and many other places.
In browser the global object is "window" and in node it is something else.

What is this?
At this global level/Global exectuion context the "this" is equal to "window"


What is global space?
Any code we write in a JS program which is not inside a function is called global space.

Whenever we create any variables or functions in the global space then the variables and functions get attached to the global object that is "window".
