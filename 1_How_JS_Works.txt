"Everything in JS happens inside an execution context"


Execution context is like a big box and it has two components:

1) Memory component:
This is the place where all the variables and functions store as a key-value pairs.

Ex:
a:1
function1 : {}

This Memory component is also known as variable Environment.

2) Code Component:
This is the place where code is executed one line at a time.

This code component is also known as thread of execution.

***** JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language

Single Threaded - Execute single line at a time
synchrnonus - Executes in a specific order, it goes to the next line only after the present line is executed
